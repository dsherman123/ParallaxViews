  <section id="About Me">
    <h2>David S. Sherman, Ph.D.</h2>
   
<p>David has a wide variety of experience in his background.  Trained and licensed as a psychotherapist, David had a private practice and taught at Pepperdine University Graduate School of Education and Psychology for a number of years.  David then focused his efforts on modernizing and bringing a family run 16mm film and filmstrip business (AIMS Multimedia) into the 21st century.  Through his focus on technology, David designed and authored interactive computer software for the Apple II, Mac, and Windows platforms.  David pioneered the first online video-on-demand interactive streaming digital business (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalCurriculum">DigitalCurriculum</a>), that reached over twenty million students and teachers and resulted in a sale of the family business to Discovery Communications Incorporated.  </p>
<p> Enticed out of retirement by a startup SaaS business idea for online employee assessments, David became the co-founder and COO/CFO of <a href="https://www.criteriacorp.com">Criteria Corp</a> a web-based pre-employment testing business using the same Software as a Service (SaaS) model he developed at AIMS.  David retired from Criteria Corp in July 2024 but continues as a Board Director.  </p>
  <p>  David continues to consult with entrepreneurs on startup business ideas.  </p>

David has a bachelor's in Psychology & Social Relations from Harvard University, a master's from the University of Southern California, and a doctorate from the University of California at Los Angeles.

<p>David Sherman is currently working on his novel, <a href="https://www.aquestionofbalance.com">A Question of Balance</a>&mdash;a thought-provoking murder mystery probing the uneasy space where psychology, philosophy, and religion collide.
    </p>

    <p>As a result of his education, David Sherman has developed a diverse set of skills that enhance his effectiveness in various professional roles. Notably: </p>
<p>Strategic Planning: His educational background in psychology helps him understand organizational behavior and dynamics, aiding in the development of strategic plans that align with human resources needs and business goals.</p>

<p>Business Development: David’s studies and experiences have equipped him with the ability to identify growth opportunities, assess market conditions, and create innovative business solutions, particularly in technology and services.</p>

<p>Organizational Management: Understanding psychological principles allows him to implement effective management practices, fostering a collaborative work environment and optimizing team performance.</p>

<p>Analytical Skills: His foundation in research and evaluation from his studies enables him to analyze data critically and make informed decisions that impact organizational success, particularly in areas like employee testing and performance assessment.</p>

<p>Communication Skills: The educational experience often emphasizes effective communication, which David has applied in consulting, training, and teaching roles, ensuring that ideas and strategies are clearly conveyed to different audiences.</p>

<p>Interpersonal Skills: David's background in psychotherapy also enhances his ability to navigate complex human interactions, making him adept at handling employee relations and organizational conflict.</p>

<p>Through these skills, David is able to bridge the gaps between technology, human resources, and business, making significant contributions to his fields of expertise.</p>
