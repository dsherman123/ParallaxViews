<h3>About ParallaX Views</h3>
<p><strong>ParallaX Views, LLC</strong> is led by <strong>David S. Sherman, Ph.D.</strong>&mdash;entrepreneur, business strategist, educator, and licensed psychotherapist. With a career spanning technology, media, psychology, and product design, David brings a unique perspective to strategy and leadership.</p>
<p>At the heart of ParallaX Views is <strong><em>ParallaX Thinking</em></strong>&mdash;the practice of examining challenges from multiple, often contrasting vantage points to uncover blind spots, challenge assumptions, and surface deeper insights. This perspective-shifting approach is paired with <strong>Divergent Thinking</strong>, the process of generating a wide field of possibilities before converging on evidence-based solutions. Together, they create a dynamic balance: <em>seeing differently and imagining broadly </em>in order to help founders and organizations make smarter, faster, and more resilient decisions.</p>
<h3>Entrepreneurial Journey</h3>
<p>In the early 1980s, David was Principal and Co-President of <strong>AIMS Media</strong> with his brothers, where he modernized its 16mm film and filmstrip library into <strong>AIMS Multimedia</strong>, a pioneer in educational technology. Drawing on Pinchot&rsquo;s principles of intrapreneuring, he spearheaded the development of <strong>DigitalCurriculum</strong>, the first streaming video-on-demand service for education, which served more than 20 million students when it was acquired by <strong>Discovery Communications, Inc.</strong> in 2004.</p>
<p>After a brief retirement, David co-founded <strong><a href="https://www.criteriacorp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Criteria Corp</a></strong>, the first SaaS pre-employment assessment platform, where he served as COO until his second retirement in 2024. Under his leadership, Criteria expanded into a global talent assessment and development platform&mdash;delivering validated pre- and post-hire assessments, structured interviewing solutions, and collaboration tools. Today, Criteria supports more than 4,000 organizations worldwide, with over 60 million assessments administered in 30 languages across 60+ countries. David continues to serve on its Board of Directors.</p>
<h3>Beyond Business</h3>
<p>Alongside his entrepreneurial work, David remains deeply engaged in psychology and the arts. He is a licensed psychotherapist and continues to advise startups and young entrepreneurs. In addition, he has dedicated himself to his literary work, most notably his debut novel, <em><a href="https://www.aquestionofbalance.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Question of Balance</a></em> &mdash;a psychological-philosophical murder mystery.</p>
